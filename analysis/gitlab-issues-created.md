17. **#17** - Port Calamares installer to ARM64 architecture
18. **#18** - Test installation process on ARM64 hardware
19. **#19** - Validate AcreetionOS customizations on ARM64
20. **#20** - Test desktop environment customizations on ARM64
21. **#21** - Comprehensive testing across ARM64 platforms
22. **#22** - Performance optimization and system tuning for ARM64

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (2 issues)
23. **#23** - Integration with official AcreetionOS ARM64 infrastructure (ðŸš¨ **EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY**)
24. **#24** - Final testing, documentation, and release preparation

## Labels Applied

All issues are properly labeled for organization:
- **Phase labels**: `phase-1`, `phase-2`, `phase-3`, `phase-4`
- **Category labels**: `arm64`, `infrastructure`, `packages`, `hardware`, `desktop`, `testing`, etc.
- **Priority indicators**: `blocker`, `external-dependency` for critical path items

## Critical Path Items

### High Priority Blockers
- **Issue #3**: AcreetionOS ARM64 repository infrastructure (external dependency)
- **Issue #23**: Production infrastructure integration (external dependency)

### Foundation Dependencies
Issues #1-#8 must be completed before Phase 2 can begin effectively.

## Milestones to Create Manually

Since glab doesn't support milestone creation, please create these milestones manually in the GitLab web interface:

### Milestone 1: "Phase 1 - Foundation and Infrastructure"
- **Description**: Establish ARM64 build capability and basic system
- **Due Date**: ~12 weeks from start (2025-12-16)
- **Issues**: #1-#8

### Milestone 2: "Phase 2 - Hardware Support and Drivers"
- **Description**: Add comprehensive ARM64 hardware support
- **Due Date**: ~20 weeks from start (2026-02-10)
- **Issues**: #9-#16

### Milestone 3: "Phase 3 - System Integration and Testing"
- **Description**: Complete system functionality and installer
- **Due Date**: ~26 weeks from start (2026-03-24)
- **Issues**: #17-#22

### Milestone 4: "Phase 4 - Production Readiness"
- **Description**: Release preparation and optimization
- **Due Date**: ~30 weeks from start (2026-04-21)
- **Issues**: #23-#24

## Next Steps

1. **Create milestones** manually in GitLab web interface
2. **Assign issues to milestones** using the GitLab web interface
3. **Assign team members** to appropriate issues based on expertise
4. **Set up project board** for visual progress tracking
5. **Begin work on Phase 1 issues**, starting with the critical path items

## Project Management

The issues are structured to follow a logical dependency chain:
- **Phase 1** establishes the foundation
- **Phase 2** builds hardware and package support
- **Phase 3** integrates and tests the complete system
- **Phase 4** prepares for production release

Each issue includes detailed task lists, acceptance criteria, and priority levels to guide development work.

## Success Metrics

With these 24 issues completed successfully, the project will deliver:
- âœ… Production-ready AcreetionOS ARM64 distribution
- âœ… Support for multiple ARM64 hardware platforms
- âœ… Complete installation and customization system
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation and user guides
- âœ… Ongoing maintenance and support procedures

Total estimated timeline: **24-30 weeks** with proper resources and external cooperation.
