# Custom Arch Linux Distro Analysis Plan

## Context & Goal
I'm helping analyze a custom Arch Linux distro to understand its structure and eventually port it to ARM architecture. This is my first time building an OS, coming from Fedora desktop/server administration and desktop application development experience.

**Current Situation:**
- Friends have working x86 ISO of custom Arch distro
- Multiple GitLab repos with unclear organization
- Informal Discord-based workflow (no formal documentation)
- I need to understand their build process before attempting ARM port

## Folder Structure

```
dev/
├── upstream-repos/          # Original clones of their repos
│   ├── repo-1/
│   ├── repo-2/
│   ├── repo-n/
├── my-forks/               # My forks for ARM development
│   ├── repo-1/
│   ├── repo-2/
├── analysis/              # My documentation and findings
│   ├── repo-inventory.md
│   ├── dependency-map.md
│   ├── build-process.md
│   └── arm-considerations.md
└── notes/                 # Session notes and discoveries
```

## Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Repository Inventory
For each repo in `upstream-repos/`, help me understand:

1. **Repository Classification**
   - What type of component is this in a Linux distro context?
   - Is this a custom package, kernel patches, build tools, or configuration?
   - How does this fit into the overall distro architecture?

2. **Build Analysis**
   - What are the key files that indicate build process? (PKGBUILD, Makefile, configure scripts, etc.)
   - What are the build dependencies?
   - Does this cross-compile easily or have architecture-specific components?

3. **Customization Level**
   - Is this a fork of an existing Arch package?
   - What appears to be custom vs. standard Arch approach?
   - Are there patches or modifications that would affect ARM compilation?

### Phase 2: Dependency Mapping
Help me create a build order by understanding:
- Which repos depend on outputs from other repos?
- What's the logical build sequence?
- Are there circular dependencies or complex interdependencies?

### Phase 3: Build Process Understanding
Focus on main build scripts to understand:
- How do they generate the final ISO?
- What tools do they use? (archiso, custom scripts, etc.)
- Where are configuration files that would need ARM-specific changes?

### Phase 4: ARM Considerations
For each component, help identify:
- Architecture-specific code or configurations
- Bootloader requirements that differ between x86 and ARM
- Kernel configurations that need ARM variants
- Package dependencies that might not be available for ARM

## Key Questions to Explore

### For Each Repository:
1. "Analyze the file structure and main build files in this repo. What type of distro component is this?"

2. "What are the key dependencies and how would this need to change for ARM cross-compilation?"

3. "Are there any obvious architecture-specific elements that would need modification?"

4. "How does this component integrate with a typical Arch Linux build process?"

### For Build Scripts:
1. "Walk me through this build process step by step. What does each phase accomplish?"

2. "Where are the architecture-specific configurations that would need ARM variants?"

3. "What tools and dependencies does this build process require?"

### For Custom Packages:
1. "How does this differ from the standard Arch package for this software?"

2. "What patches or customizations are applied and why?"

3. "Would these customizations work on ARM or need modification?"

## Expected Outputs

By the end of this analysis, I should have:

- **Repository Inventory**: Clear categorization of each repo's purpose
- **Dependency Map**: Understanding of build order and interdependencies  
- **Build Process Documentation**: Step-by-step breakdown of how they create the ISO
- **ARM Considerations**: List of components that need architecture-specific changes
- **Development Roadmap**: Prioritized list of what to tackle first for ARM port

## Analysis Session Notes Template

For each repo analyzed, document:

```markdown
## Repo: [repo-name]

**Type**: [custom package/build tool/configuration/etc.]
**Purpose**: [what this component does]
**Architecture Dependencies**: [x86-specific elements identified]
**Build Dependencies**: [what this needs to compile]
**Custom Elements**: [how this differs from standard Arch]
**ARM Considerations**: [what needs to change for ARM]
**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low for ARM port]
```

**Next Steps**: Start with the main build script repository to get the overall picture, then work through individual components based on the dependency map we discover.
